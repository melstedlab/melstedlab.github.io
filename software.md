## Software

### KmerStream

KmerStream is a program that implements a streaming algorithm for determining the number of distinct k-mers in High Throughput Sequencing datasets. For DNA sequencing experiments, KmerStream can be used to determine the size of the genome as well as the k-mer error rate for the experiment.

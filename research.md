## Research

### Bioinformatics

The main research focus is on Bioinformatics and Computational
Biology. My current research projects include developing methods for
memory efficient methods for de novo transcriptome assembly and whole
genome assembly for mammalian sized genomes. The advent of High
Throughput Sequencing (HTS) has enabled us to obtain massive amounts
of DNA and RNA data from various \*-seq experiments. However working
with this data can be nontrivial. In organisms without a known or well
annotated reference genome this is requires a considerable
computational effort to construct the genome or transcriptome from
scratch. One of the major bottlenecks is memory usage that is made
worse from the presence of errors in the sequencing
reads. My work focuses on developing algorithms and software
to reduce the amount of memory needed so that smaller labs can work
with novel data without access to a supercomputer. Additionally we are
developing a robust assembly platform that has been used for de novo
RNA-seq assembly and de novo Mitochondrial assembly.
